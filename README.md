Hello and thank you for considering my application. 
Ever since I was a little child I started fiddling around with game files. I used to make my own sims vanilla skins in mspaint. 
Videogames have been a fundamental part of my life. Thanks to them I've learned English as a second language. 
I want to be a game developer so much that I started this assignment on thursday and been developing almost non-stop until now that I'm about to finally present it...
It could be better but given the short time span I think it's pretty decent and I'm proud of my submit.
Whatever happens next, I really enjoyed working on this project.

Best,
Francisco
